## Problem Domain

Implement a Queue using two Stacks.

---

### Big O

* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(n)

---

1. Create a new class called PseudoQueue
2. Create two Stack instances inside PseudoQueue

**PseudoQueue** has the following methods:

* enqueue
  * Arguments: value
  * Inserts value into PseudoQueue, using first-in, first-out approach (but via the two Stacks inside)

* dequeue
  * Arguments: none
  * Extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using first-in, first-out approach (but via the two Stacks inside)

The two **Stack** instances have the following methods:

* push

* pop

* peek
